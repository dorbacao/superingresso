## Creating Pull Requests

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/mostafizurhimself/admintoolkit-html/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
2. Create a new branch based on the `main` branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/new-feature` or `bugfix/issue-123`).
3. Implement your changes, ensuring adherence to the [coding guidelines](#coding-guidelines).
4. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows defined [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format. Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

5. Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
6. Open a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch of the original repository.
7. Provide a detailed description of your changes and the problem they address in the PR description.

Our team will review your PR, provide feedback if needed, and merge it once it meets our standards.

## Coding Guidelines

- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Adhere to the existing coding style, including indentation and formatting.
- Add comments, especially in complex sections, to enhance understanding.
